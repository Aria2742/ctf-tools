# CPP

# Description
We have this program's source code, but it uses a strange DRM solution. Can you crack it?

# Forward / Thoughts After Solving
The path I took to solving this is much longer than it needed to be. There were multiple points where I should've noticed that the flag can be brute forced one letter at a time. That being said, I will still explain my entire process for solving this challenge.
